# **📂 SQL**

This folder contains **SQL queries** for my homework assignments. Each file demonstrates practical SQL skills using joins, aggregations, subqueries, and CTEs.

## **🔍 Overview of Queries**

* **💰 Customer Analysis**

  * Top customers by revenue

  * Customer payments vs. orders (debt tracking)

* **📦 Product & Sales Insights**

  * Bottom & top products by quantity sold

  * Total sales per order date

  * Product profitability calculations

* **🧑‍💼 Employee & Order Analysis**

  * Detailed order info with revenue, profit & sales rep

## **🗂 Structure**

* Queries are self-contained and can be run independently

* Use of:

  * **JOINs** (INNER, LEFT) to combine tables

  * **Aggregations** (`SUM`, `AVG`) for analysis

  * **CTEs** for readability and organization

## **⚡ Usage**

1. Open your SQL client (MySQL, DB2, etc.)

2. Load the database with relevant tables

3. Run the queries in each file to see results
